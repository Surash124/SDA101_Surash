## 1.Documentation  (Web Design KHSS)
In this project, I designed a web layout for *KHS Website* using Figma.  
I applied the following concepts:  
- Frames to structure the web layout.  
- Auto-layout for proper alignment and spacing.  
- Text styles for headings, subheadings, and body text.  
- Consistent use of colors and images to make the design visually clear.  
- Grouping and layers to keep the design organized.  

Through this practical, I gained skills in working with *auto-layout, **typography hierarchy, and **component organization* in Figma.  

## Reflection  
I learned how to plan and design a webpage using professional design practices.  
This exercise improved my understanding of how to structure a website layout and make it user-friendly.  

### Challenges Faced  
- At first, I found it difficult to align elements properly, but using *auto-layout* solved the issue.  
- I also had problems exporting screenshots (black screen issue), so I used the *Export feature* in Figma instead.  
- Another challenge was selecting good fonts and colors, but I practiced applying hierarchy and contrast.  

By overcoming these problems, I became more confident with Figma tools and web design basics.  

## Clarity & Coherence  
This reflection is written in a clear and simple way to show the steps I followed, the knowledge I gained, and the challenges I solved.

## 2.Documentation (Student Profile) 
In this project, I created a *Student Profile & Routine webpage* using HTML and CSS.  
The main features included:  
- Profile section with personal details and an image.  
- Daily routine represented in a clean layout.  
- Weekly schedule designed using List(ul/ol).  
I applied semantic HTML elements, CSS selectors, and custom styling to complete the design.  

## Reflection  
I learned how to build and style a webpage that combines *profile information with structured schedules*.  
This practical improved my skills in:  
- Using *semantic HTML tags* for better structure.  
- Applying *CSS layout techniques* like flexbox and grid.  
- Using External Styling for effective and clearness 

### Challenges Faced  
- At first, i didnt get the clear idea or had any knowledge of how List are made, so i had used numbers by typing
![List usage Issue](flexbox_problem.png)  

- Didn't understand how the lines were arranged.I wrote all in same line coloum at first.

By overcoming these issues, I became more confident in combining HTML and CSS to make functional, well-structured webpages.
